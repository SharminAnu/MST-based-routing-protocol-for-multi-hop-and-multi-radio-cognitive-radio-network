# MST-based-routing-protocol-for-multi-hop-and-multi-radio-cognitive-radio-network
 Theoretical graph methods are utilized in traditional multi-hop networks. However, it fails to model multi-hop Cognitive Radio Networks efficiently and to capture required information for optimal routing. For this reasons, a multi-edge planer graph has been designed where conventional routing protocol like AODV, DSDV can be implemented. In multi-edge graph representation, along with the increased number of nodes and edges in the network, more bandwidth is required to update and maintain the routing table. Hence, the overhead for updating and maintaining these tables will increase and degrade the performance of the network. In this paper, a Minimum Spanning Tree (MST) based routing protocol is employed on the planer graph model which is useful to eliminate redundant links and to prevent possible network loops. In this case, the performance of the network will not be affected with increasing number of nodes.
